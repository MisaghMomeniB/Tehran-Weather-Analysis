# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze weather data over time. Using data visualization techniques and statistical analysis, we examine trends in weather-related factors such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions. The project uses **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to load, process, and visualize weather data stored in a CSV file.

### 🛠️ Features:
- **Data Overview**: Display basic information and statistical summary of the weather data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed trends over time.
- **Weather Condition Frequency**: Plot the frequency distribution of different weather conditions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze and visualize the correlation between numeric weather variables.

### 🧑‍💻 Getting Started:
To get started, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries.

#### 📥 Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

#### 📂 How to Run:
1. **Download** the repository or script to your local machine.
2. **Update the File Path**:
    - Replace `'weather-csv.csv'` with the actual path to your weather data CSV file.
3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python weather_analysis.py
    ```
4. **Output**: The script will generate visualizations for temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed trends. It will also display the frequency of different weather conditions and a correlation matrix of the numeric variables.

### 🧐 Code Breakdown:

Here’s a breakdown of what the code does:

#### 1. **Data Loading & Overview**:
   - The script starts by loading the weather data from the CSV file.
   - It then prints basic information about the dataset, such as data types and missing values, followed by a statistical summary (e.g., mean, standard deviation).

```python
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
```

#### 2. **Data Conversion**:
   - The `Date` column is converted to a `datetime` format to facilitate time-based analysis.

```python
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
```

#### 3. **Time Series Visualization**:
   - The script plots four subplots that show trends in **temperature**, **humidity**, **pressure**, and **wind speed** over time. Each plot represents how these weather factors change on different dates.

```python
sns.lineplot(x=data['Date'], y=data['Temperature (°C)'], color='orange')
```

#### 4. **Weather Condition Frequency**:
   - A **countplot** is generated to show the frequency of different weather conditions in the dataset, helping to identify the most common weather states (e.g., sunny, rainy).

```python
sns.countplot(y=data['Weather Condition'], palette='viridis', orient="h")
```

#### 5. **Correlation Matrix**:
   - The correlation between numeric columns (temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed) is calculated and displayed in a **heatmap** to help identify relationships between these variables.

```python
correlation_matrix = numeric_data.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
```

### 📊 Visualizations:
- **Temperature Trends Over Time**: Visualizes how the temperature changes over time.
- **Humidity Trends Over Time**: Shows the trend of humidity over time.
- **Pressure Trends Over Time**: Plots how atmospheric pressure changes over time.
- **Wind Speed Trends Over Time**: Displays trends in wind speed.
- **Weather Condition Frequency**: A horizontal bar chart representing the frequency of each weather condition.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap visualizing the correlation between numeric weather variables.

### 🔧 Future Improvements:
- **Advanced Time Series Forecasting**: Implement time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future weather conditions.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Integrate location-based data to analyze weather patterns across different regions.
- **Weather Prediction Models**: Explore machine learning models to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
